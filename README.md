As a safer alternative to C, Rust is a language for programming system software
with a type-safe compiler to check its memory and concurrency safety. To
facilitate a smooth transition from C to Rust in an existing project, and lay a
solid foundation for an initial Rust re-implementation of existing
functionalities in C, it would be helpful to have a source-to-source transpiler
that can transform programs from C to Rust using program transformation
technologies. However, existing C-to-Rust transformation tool sets have the
drawback that they largely preserve the unsafe semantics of C, while rewriting
them in Rust syntax. As such, the safety of the resulting Rust programs still
depends primarily on the programmers, rather than on the Rust compiler. To gain
more safety guarantees, in this demo, we present CRustS a systematic
source-to-source transformation approach to increase the ratio of the code
passing the safety checks of Rust compiler by relaxing the semantics-preserving
constraints of the transformation. Our method uses 220 [TXL](http://txl.ca)
source-to-source transformation rules, of which 198 are strictly
semantics-preserving and 22 are semantics approximating, thus reducing the
scope of unsafe expressions and exposing more opportunities for safe
refactoring. Our method has been evaluated on both open-source and commercial
projects. Our solution demonstrates significantly higher safe code ratios after
the transformations, with function-level safe code ratios comparable to the
average level of idiomatic Rust projects.

Compared to the [Laertes](https://doi.org/10.1145/3485498)[OOPSLAâ€™21], with
respect to their own benchmarks, the safe ratio obtained by CRustS is much
higher.


## Installation

```bash
# install c2rust
if [ $(uname -s) == "Darwin" ]; then
   git clone https://github.com/immunant/c2rust 
   cd c2rust
   scripts/provision_mac.sh
   cargo build --release
   cp target/release/c2rust $HOME/.cargo/bin
   cp target/release/c2rust-transpile $HOME/.cargo/bin
   cp target/release/c2rust-analyze $HOME/.cargo/bin
   cp target/release/c2rust-instrument $HOME/.cargo/bin
   cd -
   brew install bear
   export PATH=$HOME/.local/bin:$HOME/.cargo/bin:$PATH

   cargo install crusts

elif [ $(uname -s) == "Linux" ]; then
   apt install llvm cmake clang libclang-dev bear -y
   LLVM_LIB_DIR=/usr/lib/llvm-14/lib/ cargo install c2rust
   curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
   rustup override set nightly-2021-11-22-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu
   rustup component add rustfmt --toolchain nightly-2021-11-22-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu
   export PATH=$HOME/.local/bin:$HOME/.cargo/bin:$PATH

   cargo install crusts

else

   docker pull yijun/crusts

fi
```

## Usage:

Run `crusts` in the folder where there is a `Makefile`, using

```bash
crusts [-v | -c2rust]
```
or 
```bash
docker run -v $(pwd):/mnt -t yijun/crusts [-v | -c2rust]
```

As a result, Rust code will be generated from the C code:
```
src/*.rs -- contains transpiled and refactored Rust code from the C code;
Cargo.toml build.rs lib.rs -- contains the `cargo build` configurations;
```

### Options

* `-v` -- version information

* `-c2rust` -- only run [c2rust](https://github.com/immunant/c2rust)
